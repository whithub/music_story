        \"Tim\" McGraw (born May 1, 1967 in Delhi, Louisiana) is an American country
        singer and actor. With many of his albums and singles topping the country
        music charts, Tim has achieved total album sales in excess of 40 million units.
        He is married to country singer Faith Hill and is the son of former baseball
        player Tug McGraw. His trademark hit songs include Indian Outlaw, Don''t Take
        the Girl, I Like It, I Love It, Something Like That, It''s Your Love (featuring
        his wife, Faith Hill), and Live Like You Were Dying.  McGraw had eleven consecutive
        albums to debut at Number One on the Billboard albums charts; Twenty-one singles
        to hit number 1 on the Billboard Hot Country 100 chart; three singles named
        the #1 country song of the year; (It''s Your Love, Just to See You Smile,
        and Live Like You Were Dying) Won 3 Grammys, 14 Academy of Country Music awards,
        11 Country Music Association (CMA) awards, 10 American Music Awards and 3
        People''s Choice Awards. Ranked as one of the top five in all genres of music,
        his Soul2Soul II tour with Faith Hill became the highest-grossing tour in
        country music history.  McGraw has ventured into acting, with a supporting
        role in the Billy Bob Thornton film, friday night lights, a role in the kingdom,
        a lead role in 2006''s flicka and a supporting role in four christmases with
        Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon. He is also a minority owner of the Arena
        Football League''s Nashville Kats.  McGraw came to the attention of Curb Records
        in 1990. After cutting a demo single, McGraw gave a copy to his father, Tug
        McGraw. A man who was friends with Curb Records executives heard the demo
        while driving with Tug McGraw one day and recommended that Curb contact the
        young singer. Several weeks after he was able to play his tape for Curb executives,
        they signed him to a recording contract. Two years later, in 1992, he had
        his first minor hit Welcome to the Club off his self-titled debut album, Tim
        McGraw. Although the album failed to make much of a dent on the charts, McGraw
        did have two other minor hits from it in 1993, Memory Lane and Two Steppin
        Mind.  All I Want, released in 1995, continued his run of success, debuting
        at number one on the country charts. The album sold over two million copies
        and reached the top 5 on the Billboard 200. I Like It, I Love It reached number
        one on the country charts as the leadoff single, while She Never Lets It Go
        to Her Heart also went to number one in 1996. Can''t Be Really Gone, All I
        Want Is a Life, and Maybe We Should Just Sleep on It were all top 5 hits.  In
        1996, McGraw headlined the most successful country tour of the year, The Spontaneous
        Combustion Tour, with Faith Hill as his supporting act. Faith Hill broke off
        her engagement to her former producer Scott Hendricks so that she and Tim
        could start dating each other; then married on October 6, 1996. The couple
        have since had three daughters, Gracie Katherine (born May 1997), Maggie Elizabeth
        (born August 1998) and Audrey Caroline (born December 2001).  McGraw''s next
        album, 1997''s Everywhere, again topped the country charts and reached number
        two on the album charts, selling 4 million copies. The first single, It''s
        Your Love, a duet with Faith Hill, became the first single in twenty years
        to spend six weeks on top of Billboard''s country singles chart (the previous
        such song had been Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson''s \"Luckenbach, Texas
        (Back to the Basics of Love)\" in 1977). The single reached #7 on the pop
        chart (and gained platinum status); and became the most played single in the
        history of the Billboard country charts. Five more singles Everywhere, Where
        the Green Grass Grows, One of These Days, For a Little While, and Just to
        See You Smile reached the top of the country charts from the album, with the
        last of these setting a new record by spending 42 weeks on the Billboard charts.
        The Country Music Association awarded Everywhere its Album of the Year award
        for 1997.  A Place in the Sun in 1999 continued McGraw''s streak, debuting
        atop both the US pop and country album charts and selling three million albums.
        It featured another four chart topping singles on the country charts including
        Please Remember Me, Something Like That, My Best Friend, and My Next Thirty
        Years; Some Things Never Change reached #7 on the country chart. He also contributed
        a song for the Grammy-winning tribute album to Bob Wills, Ride With Bob. His
        song, a cover of Milk Cow Blues, was recorded as a duet with Asleep at the
        Wheel[/artost], whom he had met while performing together at the George Strait
        Country Music Festival.  McGraw recorded two more duets with his wife in the
        late 1990s, both of which appeared on her albums. Just To Hear You Say That
        You Love Me off her multi-platinum 1998 album Faith, reached the top five
        of the US country charts, while her follow-up and 1999 album Breathe featured
        Let''s Make Love, which would win a Grammy Award in 2000 for Best Country
        Vocal Collaboration.  In 2000, McGraw released his Greatest Hits album which
        topped the charts for nine weeks and sold almost 6 million copies, making
        it one of the biggest selling albums in the modern country market. In the
        latter half of the year, he and Hill went out on the Soul2Soul Tour, playing
        to sellout crowds in 64 venues including Madison Square Garden. It was one
        of the top tours of any genre in the US and the leading country tour during
        2000.  While in Buffalo, McGraw and Kenny Chesney became involved in a scuffle
        with police officers after Chesney, who had permission from the sheriff''s
        daughter, attempted to ride a police horse. McGraw came to Chesney''s aid
        after police officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen and tried
        to arrest him. The two were arrested and charged with assault, but were later
        cleared. During a concert with the George Strait Country Music Festival several
        weeks later, Hill, dressed as a police officer, made an unscheduled appearance
        at the end of McGraw''s set and led him off the stage.  McGraw''s next album,
        [album artist=tim mcgraw]Set This Circus Down, was released in April 2001
        and spawned four number one country hits - Grown Men Don''t Cry, Angry All
        the Time (with Faith Hill), The Cowboy in Me, and Unbroken. He also provided
        harmony vocals for the Jo Dee Messina song Bring On The Rain, which he also
        produced. The song topped the country charts.  Hungry for more of his music,
        fans downloaded a version of his performance of the song Things Change from
        his appearance at the Country Music Association Awards Show. The song was
        played extensively on radio, becoming the first country song to appear on
        the charts from a fully downloaded version.  In 2002, Tim McGraw bucked country
        music traditions by recording his album Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors
        with his tour band The Dancehall Doctors. Unlike rock music, where it is commonplace
        for touring bands to provide the music on albums recorded by the artist they
        support, country albums are typically recorded with session musicians. McGraw
        chose to use his own touring band in order to recognize their part in his
        success and to capture some of the feel of a real band.  All of the Dancehall
        Doctors have worked with McGraw since at least 1996. They include:      *
        Darran Smith - Lead Guitar, Acoustic guitar     * Bob Minner - Rhythm Guitar,
        Acoustic guitar, Banjo, Mandolin     * Denny Hemingson - Steel Guitar, Electric,
        Baritone, and Slide Guitars, Dobro     * John Marcus - Bass guitar     * Dean
        Brown - Fiddle, Mandolin     * Jeff McMahon - Piano, Organ, Synthesizer, Keyboards     *
        Billy Mason - Drums     * David Dunkley - Percussion.  The album debuted at
        number 2 on the country albums charts, with the single Real Good Man reaching
        number one on the Hot Country Songs chart. She''s My Kind of Rain reached
        number 2 in 2003 and Red Ragtop reached the top 5. The album also featured
        a cover version of an early Elton John 1970 classic Tiny Dancer, as well as
        appearances by Kim Carnes on Comfort Me - a response to the September 11,
        2001 attacks - and Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit of the Eagles on Illegal.  2004''s
        Live Like You Were Dying continued McGraw''s record of commercial success.
        The title track, dedicated to his father Tug McGraw who died of a brain tumor
        earlier in the year, was a soaring ode to living life fully and in the moment,
        while the second single Back When was a paean to an easy nostalgia. Live Like
        You Were Dying spent seven non-consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard (10 weeks
        on Radio & Records) and went on to become the biggest hit single of the year.
        It also became one the most awarded songs/records by winning ACM Single and
        Song of the Year, CMA Single and Song of the Year and a Grammy.  In late 2004,
        his unlikely duet with hip-hop artist Nelly on Over And Over, a soft ballad
        of lost love, became a crossover hit spending 10 weeks atop the Top 40 chart.
        This made Tim the first modern country artist to have two 10 week number one
        hits in a single year. \"Over and Over\" brought McGraw a success he had never
        previously experienced on contemporary hit radio, rap radio, and brought both
        artists success neither had previously experienced in the hot adult contemporary
        market. The song also spent a week at the top of the UK single charts, and
        was McGraw''s first visit to the UK hit countdown.  Throughout the 2005 NFL
        season McGraw sang an alternate version of I Like It, I Love It every week
        during the season. The alternate lyrics, which changed each week, would make
        reference to plays during Sunday''s games and the song would be played alongside
        video highlights during halftime on Monday Night Football. Later in the year
        McGraw became a minority owner of the Arena Football League''s Nashville Kats
        when majority owner Bud Adams (owner of the NFL''s Tennessee Titans) was awarded
        the expansion franchise. It was dedicated to Tug McGraw...  In April 2006
        McGraw and Hill began their 73-concert, 55 city,  Soul2Soul II Tour 2006,
        again to strong commercial acceptance. The tour grossed nearly $89 million
        and sold almost 1.1 million tickets, making it the top grossing tour in the
        history of country music. It was named \"Major Tour of the Year\" by the prestigious
        Pollstar Magazine, beating out such heavyweights as Madonna and the Rolling
        Stones. In a special gesture, the couple donated all of the profits from their
        performance in New Orleans to Hurricane Katrina relief.  Tim, along with Kenny
        Chesney, contributed to a version of Tracy Lawrence ''s song Find Out Who
        Your Friends Are, which can be found on Lawrence''s album For The Love. Although
        the official single version features only Lawrence''s vocals, many stations
        have opted to play the version with McGraw and Chesney instead.  McGraw released
        his eleventh album, Let It Go, on March 27, 2007. The album''s debut single,
        Last Dollar (Fly Away), reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, marking
        Tim''s first No. 1 single since Back When in late 2004. The album debuted
        at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Album Chart and #1 on the Billboard Country
        Album chart, marking his 4th #1 top 200 album and 9th #1 country album. His
        daughters can be heard singing the chorus during the last few seconds of the
        song on the video.  During the Academy of Country Music awards show on May
        21, 2007, McGraw performed a song titled If You''re Reading This, which he
        co-wrote with The Warren Brothers. Several radio stations began to play the
        live recording of the song; as a result, it entered the Hot Country Songs
        chart at #35.  McGraw also produced the debut album of country music duo Halfway
        to Hazard. The duo''s first single, Daisy, peaked at #39 on the country charts
        in Summer of 2007.  In the summer of 2007 McGraw and Hill toured together
        once again in the Soul2Soul 2007 tour.  In the January 18, 2008 edition of
        the USA Today newspaper, McGraw was featured on the Def Leppard album Songs
        From The Sparkle Lounge and has co-written the first single, Nine Lives, with
        Def Leppard band members Joe Elliott, Phil Collen and Rick Savage. The unusual
        pairing goes back to 2006 when McGraw joined Def Leppard onstage for the song
        Pour Some Sugar on Me. The album has a release date of May 6, 2008.  In May
        2008 he hit the road with the Live Your Voice Tour. The mainly outdoor arena
        concert tour will be his first solo outing in nearly three years. Also in
        May 2008, he debuted a new song off of his follow-up to Let It Go at the Stagecoach
        Music Festival in Indio, California.  In July 2008, Tim McGraw''s sixth single,
        and the title track of his album, Let It Go, was released to country radio.
        Following that, a seventh single, Nothin'' To Die For, entered the Country
        charts at 57 late December. Tim McGraw released his third greatest hits package,
        Greatest Hits 3 on October 7, 2008. The album features 12 tracks. No new material
        was recorded for the compilation. A new album of all new material was scheduled
        for release in October, but has since been pushed back to 2009.  The Better
        Than I Used To Be Songfacts states that after over 20 years with Curb Records
        and a legal battle, Tim McGraw finally left the label after a judge freed
        him from his contract. Curb immediately released Better Than I Used To Be
        as the second single from Emotional Traffic, an album that had been shelved
        for several months following the dispute.  The Truck Yeah Songfacts reports
        that McGraw signed with Big Machine Records on May 21, 2012.", "site": "last.fm",

        McGraw (born May 1, 1967) is an American singer and actor. He has been married
        to fellow singer Faith Hill since 1996, and is the son of the late baseball
        player Tug McGraw. \nMcGraw has released thirteen studio albums: eleven for
        Curb Records and two for Big Machine Records. Ten of his albums have reached
        number 1 on the Top Country Albums charts, with his 1994 breakthrough album
        Not a Moment Too Soon being the top country album of 1994. These albums have
        produced over 50 singles, of which 25 have reached number 1 on the Hot Country
        Songs or Country Airplay charts. Three of his singles -- \"It''s Your Love\",
        \"Just to See You Smile\", and \"Live Like You Were Dying\" -- were the top
        country songs of 1997, 1998, and 2004 respectively, according to Billboard
        Year-End. He has also won three Grammy Awards, 14 Academy of Country Music
        awards, 11 Country Music Association (CMA) awards, 10 American Music Awards,
        and three People''s Choice Awards. His Soul2Soul II Tour with Faith Hill is
        the highest grossing tour in country music history, and one of the Top 5 among
        all genres of music. \nMcGraw has ventured into acting, with supporting roles
        in The Blind Side (with Sandra Bullock), Friday Night Lights, The Kingdom,
        and Four Christmases (with Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon), and lead roles
        in Flicka (2006) and Country Strong (2010). He was a minority owner of the
        Arena Football League''s Nashville Kats. Taylor Swift''s debut single, \"Tim
        McGraw\", refers to him and his song, \"Can''t Tell Me Nothin''\". \nIn acknowledgement
        of his grandfather''s Italian heritage, McGraw was honored by the National
        Italian American Foundation (NIAF) in 2004, receiving the NIAF Special Achievement
        Award in Music during the Foundation''s 29th Anniversary Gala. \n\nEarly life:\nSamuel
        Timothy McGraw was born in Delhi, Louisiana, the only child of Elizabeth \"Betty\"
        Ann (D''Agostino), a waitress, and Frank Edwin \"Tug\" McGraw Jr., a star
        pitcher for the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies. McGraw is of
        Italian and Irish descent on his mother''s side, and of Scots-Irish, English,
        Scottish, French, Dutch, Czech, and German descent on his father''s side.
        In 1966, Tug was a pitcher for the Jacksonville Suns, and he lived in an apartment
        above Betty D''Agostino, who attended Terry Parker High School. The pair had
        a relationship, and when Betty became pregnant, her parents sent her to Louisiana
        to live with relatives and to have the baby. \n\nRaised by his mother in Start,
        also in Richland Parish, east of Monroe, McGraw grew up believing his stepfather,
        Horace Smith, was his father. From the time of his mother''s marriage until
        the time he met his biological father, his last name was Smith. At age 11,
        McGraw discovered his birth certificate while searching his mother''s closet
        to look for Christmas presents. After his discovery, his mother revealed that
        his biological father was Tug McGraw, and took Tim to meet him for the first
        time. For seven years, Tug denied being Tim''s father. Tim was 18 years old
        when Tug first realized how much Tim looked like him at that age, and he acknowledged
        paternity. They remained close until Tug''s death in 2004. \nAs a child, McGraw
        loved to play competitive sports, including baseball, even though he did not
        know his biological father was a professional athlete. He was also a member
        of the FFA. He attended Northeast Louisiana University, now the University
        of Louisiana at Monroe, on a baseball scholarship, although he never earned
        a varsity letter; he also became a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.
        During his college period, he learned to play guitar, and would frequently
        perform and sing for tips, although he claims that his roommates often hid
        the guitar because he was so bad. \nHis mother, Betty, returned to Jacksonville,
        Florida in 1987, and McGraw followed. He attended Florida Community College
        at Jacksonville for one term, and occasionally sat in with local bands. In
        1989, on the day his hero Keith Whitley died, McGraw dropped out of college
        to head to Nashville and pursue a musical career. \n\nMusic career:\n\n1990s:\n\nTim
        McGraw:\n\nMcGraw came to the attention of Curb Records in 1990. After cutting
        a demo single, McGraw gave a copy to his father. A man who was friends with
        Curb Records executives heard the demo while driving with Tug one day and
        recommended that Curb contact the young singer. Several weeks later, he was
        able to play his tape for Curb executives, after which they signed him to
        a recording contract. McGraw''s first single, \"What Room Was the Holiday
        In\", did not enter the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts upon its release.
        In a 2001 retrospective on McGraw''s career in Billboard, a former program
        director for Nashville station WSM-FM said that he added the song to the station''s
        playlist because it showed \"undeniable promise\", while another former program
        director at WXTU in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania recalled that McGraw''s debut
        single was \"terrible\" but that he booked the singer to make an appearance
        at the station due to his father''s fame. \nThree more singles were released
        from Tim McGraw: \"Welcome to the Club\", \"Memory Lane\", and \"Two Steppin''
        Mind\", although none of these made Top 40, and the album itself did not chart.
        Both \"Memory Lane\" and \"Tears in the Rain\", another cut from the album,
        were co-written by Joe Diffie, and the former originally appeared on Keith
        Palmer''s self-titled 1991 debut album. \n\nNot a Moment Too Soon:\nHis second
        album, Not a Moment Too Soon, was much more successful, becoming the best-selling
        country album in 1994. The first single, \"Indian Outlaw\", caused considerable
        controversy, as critics argued that it presented Native Americans in a patronizing
        way. Some radio stations refused to play it, but the controversy helped spur
        sales, and the song became McGraw''s first top ten country single (getting
        as high as No. 8), and reaching No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. \nThe second
        single from the album, \"Don''t Take the Girl\", became McGraw''s first No.
        1 country hit, in addition to reaching number 17 on the Hot 100, and \"helped
        cement his image as a ruggedly good-looking guy with a sensitive side\". By
        year''s end, \"Down on the Farm\" had peaked at number 2 on the country charts;
        after it, the album''s title track became his second number 1 single in early
        1995, and \"Refried Dreams\" reached number 5 afterward. The album sold over
        6 million copies, topping the Billboard 200 as well as the country album charts.
        On the strength of this success, McGraw won Academy of Country Music awards
        for Album of the Year and Top New Male Vocalist in 1994.Billboard named Not
        a Moment Too Soon as the top country album of 1994 on Billboard Year-End.
        \n\nAll I Want:\nAll I Want, released in 1995, also debuted at No. 1 on the
        country charts. The album sold over 2 million copies and reached the top 5
        on the Billboard 200. \"I Like It, I Love It\" reached No. 1 on the country
        charts as the lead-off single, also crossing over to the Hot 100 at number
        25. The album''s next two singles, \"Can''t Be Really Gone\" and \"All I Want
        Is a Life\" both made Top 5, with \"She Never Lets It Go to Her Heart\" becoming
        his fourth number 1 in 1996. Finishing off the single releases was \"Maybe
        We Should Just Sleep on It\". \nIn 1996, McGraw headlined the most successful
        country tour of the year, The Spontaneous Combustion Tour, with Faith Hill
        as his supporting act. Hill broke off her engagement to her former producer
        Scott Hendricks so that she and McGraw could start dating each other; they
        then married on October 6, 1996. The couple have since had three daughters:
        Gracie Katherine (born May 1997), Maggie Elizabeth (born August 1998), and
        Audrey Caroline (born December 2001). \n\nEverywhere:\nMcGraw''s next album,
        1997''s Everywhere, again topped the country charts and reached No. 2 on the
        album charts, selling 4 million copies. Four singles (\"It''s Your Love\",
        \"Everywhere\", \"Where the Green Grass Grows\", and \"Just to See You Smile\")
        reached the top of the country charts from the album. The Country Music Association
        awarded Everywhere its Album of the Year award for 1997. At the 40th Grammy
        Awards \"It''s Your Love\" received two Grammy Award nominations for Best
        Country Collaboration With Vocals and Best Country Song. \"It''s Your Love\"
        and \"Just to See You Smile\" were the top country songs of 1997 and 1998,
        respectively, according to Billboard Year-End; \"Just to See You Smile\" also
        set a record for the longest run on the country charts at the time, at 42
        weeks. \n\nA Place in the Sun:\nA Place in the Sun in 1999 continued McGraw''s
        streak, debuting atop both the US pop and country album charts and selling
        3 million albums. 251,000 copies were sold in the first week, making it his
        first number 1 opener on The Billboard 200. It featured another four chart-topping
        singles on the country charts including \"Please Remember Me\", \"Something
        Like That\", \"My Best Friend\", and \"My Next Thirty Years\". \"Some Things
        Never Change\" reached No. 7 on the country chart. He also contributed a song
        for the Grammy-winning tribute album to Bob Wills: Ride With Bob. His song,
        a cover of \"Milk Cow Blues\", was recorded as a duet with Asleep at the Wheel,
        whom he had met while performing together at the George Strait Country Music
        Festival. \nMcGraw recorded two more duets with his wife in the late 1990s,
        both of which appeared on her albums. \"Just to Hear You Say That You Love
        Me\", off of her multi-platinum 1998 album Faith, reached the top five of
        the US country charts, while her follow-up and 1999 album Breathe featured
        \"Let''s Make Love\", which would win a Grammy Award in 2000 for Best Country
        Vocal Collaboration. \n\n2000s:\n\nGreatest Hits:\nIn 2000, McGraw released
        his Greatest Hits album, which topped the charts for nine weeks and sold almost
        6 million copies, making it one of the biggest-selling albums in the modern
        country market. In the latter half of the year, he and Hill went out on the
        Soul2Soul Tour, playing to sellout crowds in 64 venues, including Madison
        Square Garden. It was one of the top tours of any genre in the US, and the
        leading country tour during 2000. \nWhile in Buffalo, New York, McGraw and
        Kenny Chesney became involved in a scuffle with police officers after Chesney
        attempted to ride a police horse. McGraw came to Chesney''s aid after police
        officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen and tried to arrest him.
        The two were arrested and charged with assault, but were later cleared. During
        a concert with the George Strait Country Music Festival several weeks later,
        Hill, dressed as a police officer, made an unscheduled appearance at the end
        of McGraw''s set and led him off the stage. \n\nSet This Circus Down:\nMcGraw''s
        next album, Set This Circus Down, was released in April 2001, and spawned
        four number-one country hits: \"Grown Men Don''t Cry\", \"Angry All the Time\"
        (with Faith Hill), \"The Cowboy in Me\", and \"Unbroken\". He provided harmony
        vocals for the Jo Dee Messina song \"Bring On the Rain\", which he also produced.
        The song topped the country charts. \nHungry for more of his music, fans downloaded
        a version of his performance of the song \"Things Change\" from his appearance
        at the Country Music Association Awards Show. The song was played extensively
        on radio, becoming the first country song to appear on the charts from a fully
        downloaded version. \n\nTim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors:\nIn 2002, McGraw
        bucked country music traditions by recording his album Tim McGraw and the
        Dancehall Doctors with his tour band The Dancehall Doctors. Unlike rock music,
        where it is commonplace for touring bands to provide the music on albums recorded
        by the artist they support, country albums are typically recorded with session
        musicians. McGraw chose to use his own touring band, in order to recognize
        their part in his success, and to capture some of the feel of a real band.
        \nAll of the Dancehall Doctors have worked with McGraw since at least 1996.
        They include: \nDarran Smith - lead guitar, acoustic guitar, \nBob Minner
        - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, \nDenny Hemingson - steel
        guitar, electric, baritone, and slide guitars, dobro, \nJohn Marcus - bass
        guitar, \nDean Brown - fiddle, mandolin, \nJeff McMahon - piano, organ, synthesizer,
        keyboards, \nBilly Mason - drums, \nDavid Dunkley - percussion, \nThe album
        debuted at No. 2 on the country albums charts, with the single \"Real Good
        Man\" reaching No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart. \"She''s My Kind of Rain\"
        reached No. 2 in 2003, and \"Red Ragtop\" reached the top 5. The album also
        featured a cover version of Elton John''s early 1970s classic \"Tiny Dancer\",
        as well as appearances by Kim Carnes on \"Comfort Me\" (a response to the
        September 11, 2001 attacks) and Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit of the Eagles
        on \"Illegal\". \"She''s My Kind of Rain\" received a Grammy Award nomination
        for Best Country Vocal Performance-Male at the 46th Grammy Awards. \n\nLive
        Like You Were Dying:\n2004''s Live Like You Were Dying continued McGraw''s
        record of commercial success. The title track, dedicated to his father Tug
        McGraw, who died of a brain tumor earlier in the year, was an ode to living
        life fully and in the moment, while the second single \"Back When\" was a
        paean to an easy nostalgia. Live Like You Were Dying spent seven non-consecutive
        weeks at No. 1 on Billboard and went on to become the top country song of
        2004 on the Billboard Year-End charts. It also became one of the most awarded
        songs/records by winning ACM Single and Song of the Year, CMA Single and Song
        of the Year, and a Grammy. The album included three more singles: \"Drugs
        or Jesus\", his first single since 1993 not to reach Top 10 on the country
        charts; \"Do You Want Fries with That\", and \"My Old Friend\". \nIn late
        2004, his unlikely duet with hip-hop artist Nelly on \"Over and Over became
        a crossover hit, spending 10 weeks atop the Top 40 chart. \"Over and Over\"
        brought McGraw a success he had never previously experienced on contemporary
        hit radio or rap radio, and brought both artists success neither had previously
        experienced in the hot adult contemporary market. The song also spent a week
        at the top of the charts in the United Kingdom, becoming McGraw''s first British
        hit single and Nelly''s third number one hit in the country after Dilemma
        and My Place. ''Over and Over'' also reached the top of the charts in Australia,
        New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, and the top ten in Austria, Canada,
        Denmark, Germany, Romania and Switzerland. \nThroughout the 2005 NFL season,
        McGraw sang an alternate version of \"I Like It, I Love It\" every week during
        the season. The alternate lyrics, which changed each week, would make reference
        to plays during Sunday''s games, and the song would be played alongside video
        highlights during halftime on Monday Night Football. Later in the year, McGraw
        became a minority owner of the Arena Football League''s Nashville Kats when
        majority owner Bud Adams (owner of the NFL''s Tennessee Titans) was awarded
        the expansion franchise. \n\nLet It Go:\n\nIn April 2006, McGraw and Hill
        began their 73-concert 55-city Soul2Soul II Tour, again to strong commercial
        acceptance. The tour grossed nearly $89 million and sold almost 1.1 million
        tickets, making it the top grossing tour in the history of country music.
        It was named \"Major Tour of the Year\" by the prestigious Pollstar Magazine,
        beating out such heavyweights as Madonna and the Rolling Stones. In a special
        gesture, the couple donated all of the profits from their performance in New
        Orleans to Hurricane Katrina relief. \nMcGraw, along with Kenny Chesney, contributed
        to a version of Tracy Lawrence''s song \"Find Out Who Your Friends Are\",
        which can be found on Lawrence''s album For the Love. Although the official
        single version features only Lawrence''s vocals, many stations have opted
        to play the version with McGraw and Chesney instead. \nMcGraw released his
        eleventh album, Let It Go, on March 27, 2007. The album''s debut single, \"Last
        Dollar (Fly Away)\", reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, marking
        McGraw''s first No. 1 single since \"Back When\" in late 2004. The album debuted
        at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 Album Chart and No. 1 on the Billboard Country
        Album chart, marking his fourth No. 1 top 200 album and ninth No. 1 country
        album. His daughters can be heard singing the chorus during the last few seconds
        of the song on the video. \nDuring the Academy of Country Music awards show
        on May 21, 2007, McGraw performed a song titled \"If You''re Reading This\",
        which he co-wrote with The Warren Brothers. Several radio stations began to
        play the live recording of the song; as a result, it entered the Hot Country
        Songs chart at No. 35. \nMcGraw also produced the debut album of country music
        duo Halfway to Hazard. The duo''s first single, \"Daisy\", peaked at No. 39
        on the country charts in the summer of 2007. \nIn the summer of 2007, McGraw
        and Hill toured together once again in the Soul2Soul 2007 tour. \nIn the January
        18, 2008 edition of the USA Today newspaper, McGraw was stated to be featured
        on the Def Leppard album Songs from the Sparkle Lounge, having also co-written
        the first single, \"Nine Lives\", with Def Leppard band members Joe Elliott,
        Phil Collen, and Rick Savage. The unusual pairing goes back to 2006 when McGraw
        joined Def Leppard onstage for the song \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\", and then
        collaborated on the song \"Nine Lives\" afterward. The album was released
        on April 25, 2008. \nAt the 2007 50th Annual Grammy Awards, McGraw received
        5 nominations including Best Country Album Let It Go, Best Country Song (\"If
        You''re Reading This\" & \"I Need You\"), Best Country Collaboration with
        Vocals (\"I Need You)\"), and Best Male Country Vocal Performance (\"If You''re
        Reading This\"). \nIn May 2008, he hit the road with the Live Your Voice tour.
        The mainly-outdoor arena concert tour was his first solo outing in nearly
        three years. Also in May 2008, he debuted a new song off of his follow-up
        to Let It Go at the Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, California. \nIn July
        2008, McGraw''s sixth single, and the title track of his album, \"Let It Go\",
        was released to country radio. Following that, a seventh single, \"Nothin''
        to Die For\", entered the Country charts at No. 57 in late December. McGraw
        released his third greatest-hits package, Greatest Hits 3 on October 7, 2008.
        The album features 12 tracks. McGraw was set to debut a new song on the 2009
        ACM Awards, but then cancelled his performance; he was replaced by Blake Shelton,
        who sang \"She Wouldn''t Be Gone\". \n\nSouthern Voice:\n\nMcGraw''s twelfth
        studio album, Southern Voice, was released October 20, 2009, and led by the
        single \"It''s A Business Doing Pleasure With You\", which was shipped to
        radio outlets in late June 2009.Southern Voice was argued to be McGraw''s
        last album for Curb Records, following the dispute over releasing his third
        Greatest Hits collection back in October 2008 without his permission. McGraw
        did not approve of the release. On November 30, 2010, Curb Records released
        his fourth greatest hits compilation, Number One Hits. \n\n2010s:\n\nEmotional
        Traffic and Curb Records lawsuit:\nOn January 2, 2011, McGraw announced plans
        for his Emotional Traffic Tour featuring opening acts Luke Bryan and The Band
        Perry.Sirius XM announced on March 30, 2011 that they would be launching Tim
        McGraw radio, a commercial-free music channel devoted to McGraw''s music,
        and featuring an in depth interview with McGraw as well. \nAs of fall 2010,
        McGraw had finished work on the album Emotional Traffic, his last album with
        Curb Records. On May 13, 2011, Curb Records filed a breach-of-contract suit
        against McGraw. The label alleged that McGraw recorded tracks for his Emotional
        Traffic album too early prior to its delivery to the label. Several days later,
        McGraw filed a counter suit against the label seeking advance payment and
        recording-fund reimbursement, unspecified damages, and a jury trial. A trial
        was scheduled to begin in July 2012. \nIn November 2011, a judge granted McGraw
        permission to record music for another label, ending his relationship with
        Curb Records that began in 1990. A few hours after the ruling, Curb released
        \"Better Than I Used to Be\", the second single from Emotional Traffic. The
        album was released on January 24, 2012. \n\nTwo Lanes of Freedom:\nIn December
        2011, McGraw released his first Christmas single, \"Christmas All Over the
        World\", on his own label StyleSonic Records. On May 21, 2012, however, he
        signed with Big Machine Records. McGraw''s debut album for Big Machine, entitled
        Two Lanes of Freedom, was released on February 5, 2013. It debuted at number
        2 on the charts by selling 108,000 copies. The album includes the singles
        \"Truck Yeah\", \"One of Those Nights\", \"Highway Don''t Care\" (a duet with
        Taylor Swift which also features Keith Urban on lead guitar), and \"Southern
        Girl\". \nMcGraw performed at the C2C: Country to Country festival in London
        on March 16, 2013. \n\nLove Story and Sundown Heaven Town:\nMcGraw released
        a single titled \"Lookin'' for That Girl\" in January 2014 as the lead-off
        single to his second album for Big Machine. It was followed immediately by
        the announcement of the Sundown Heaven Town Tour. The album, titled Sundown
        Heaven Town, was released on September 16, 2014. Four months into its run,
        \"Lookin'' for That Girl\" was withdrawn as a single and replaced with \"Meanwhile
        Back at Mama''s\", which features backing vocals from Hill. \"Shotgun Rider\"
        beacme the album''s third single and a number 1 Country Airplay hit by the
        end of 2014. Following it was \"Diamond Rings and Old Barstools\", a duet
        with Catherine Dunn. \nMcGraw''s eighth greatest hits album, Love Story, is
        a compilation of his twelve biggest love songs and two previously unreleased
        recordings. It was released exclusively through Walmart on February 4, 2014,
        by Curb Records. \n\nProducer:\nMcGraw has occasionally served as a record
        producer in collaboration with Byron Gallimore, who has co-produced all of
        his albums. The two co-produced Jo Dee Messina''s self-titled debut, as well
        as her next two albums, I''m Alright and Burn. McGraw and Gallimore also produced
        the only album released by The Clark Family Experience] in 2000, and Halfway
        to Hazard''s 2007 self-titled debut album. \n\nActing career:\nMcGraw''s first
        acting appearance came in a 1997 episode of The Jeff Foxworthy Show, where
        he played Foxworthy''s rival. \nIn 2004, McGraw played a sheriff in Rick Schroder''s
        independent release Black Cloud. Later in the same year, McGraw received critical
        acclaim as the overbearing father of a running back in the major studio Texas
        high school football drama Friday Night Lights. The Dallas Observer said the
        role was \"played with unexpected ferocity by country singer Tim McGraw\".
        The movie went on to gross over $60 million worldwide at the box office, and
        sold millions in the DVD market. Most recently, it was named one of the Top
        50 High School Movies of All Time (No. 37) by Entertainment Weekly. \nMcGraw''s
        first lead role was in the 2006 film Flicka, which was released in theaters
        October 20, 2006. In the remake of the classic book My Friend Flicka, McGraw
        played the father, Rob, costarring with Alison Lohman and Maria Bello. The
        family-friendly movie debuted in the top 10 list and has grossed over $25
        million at the box office. McGraw again achieved critical acclaim for his
        acting. \nShortly before Flicka opened, McGraw received a star on the Hollywood
        Walk of Fame. His star is located at 6901 Hollywood Blvd. Near stars in the
        sidewalk honoring Julie Andrews, William Shatner, and the late Greta Garbo.
        One of his Flicka co-stars, Alison Lohman, attended the ceremony that included
        comments from Billy Bob Thornton, McGraw''s co-star in the film Friday Night
        Lights. \nIn addition to acting in Flicka, McGraw served as executive producer
        of the soundtrack album, which was released by his record label, StyleSonic
        Records, in association with Curb Records and Fox 2000 films. It featured
        the closing credit song \"My Little Girl\", one of the first two songs that
        McGraw recorded that he also co-wrote (the other being \"I''ve Got Friends
        That Do\", both of which were included on Greatest Hits Vol. 2). The song
        was nominated by the Broadcast Film Critics for \"Best Song\" in a film, and
        the movie was nominated in the category \"Best Family Film (Live Action)\".
        The movie proved to be another success in the DVD market, and has sold over
        a million copies, debuting at No. 3 on the DVD sales chart. \nMcGraw also
        had a small part in the Michael Mann-produced 2007 film The Kingdom, reuniting
        him with Friday Night Lights director Peter Berg. McGraw played a bitter,
        angered widower whose wife was killed in the terrorist attack that is the
        centerpiece of the movie. \nOn November 22, 2008, McGraw made his first appearance
        on Saturday Night Live. He also played \"Dallas McVie\" in Four Christmases.
        \nMcGraw appeared in the 2009 film The Blind Side as Sean Tuohy, husband of
        Sandra Bullock''s character, Leigh Anne Tuohy. The Blind Side is based on
        the true story of Michael Oher, a homeless African-American youngster from
        a broken home, taken in and adopted by the Tuohys, a well-to-do white family
        who help him fulfill his potential. For her performance Bullock won the Oscar
        for Best Actress in a Leading Role. \nHe is among the stars of Dirty Girl,
        a film that premiered on September 12, 2010, at the Toronto Film Festival,
        along with Juno Temple, Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy and Dwight Yoakam.
        \nAlso in 2010, McGraw starred in Country Strong as James Canter, the husband
        and manager of the fictional country singer Kelly Canter (portrayed by Gwyneth
        Paltrow). In addition to his appearance in the film, McGraw''s song \"Southern
        Voice\" was played during the closing credits. \n\nCharitable efforts:\nAs
        his success has grown, McGraw has increasingly given back to the community.
        When McGraw first reached fame in 1994, he established his annual Swampstock
        event. It began as a charity softball game to raise money for hometown little
        league programs; the event now includes a celebrity softball game and a multi-artist
        concert that attracts over 11,000 fans per year. The combined events have
        funded new Little League parks and equipment, and have established college
        scholarship funds for students in the northeast Louisiana area. \nFrom 1996
        to 1999, McGraw hosted an annual New Year''s Eve concert in Nashville with
        special guests including Jeff Foxworthy, the Dixie Chicks, and Martina McBride.
        The 1997 show raised over $100,000 for the Country Music Foundation Hall of
        Fame and Museum. Beginning in 1999, McGraw would pick select cities on each
        tour, and the night before he was scheduled to perform, would choose a local
        club and host a quickly-organized show. This tour-within-a-tour became known
        as \"The Bread and Water Tour\", and all proceeds from the show would go to
        a charity from that community. \nIn the days immediately following Hurricane
        Katrina, McGraw and his wife, who was raised in Mississippi, joined groups
        taking supplies to Gulfport, Mississippi. The two also hosted several charity
        concerts to benefit those who were displaced by the storm. Later in the year,
        the couple established the Neighbor''s Keeper Foundation, which provides funding
        for community charities to assist with basic humanitarian services, in the
        event of a natural disaster, or for desperate personal circumstances. \nMcGraw
        is also a member of the American Red Cross National Celebrity Cabinet, to
        which various celebrities donate their time, skills, and fame, to help the
        Red Cross highlight important initiatives and response efforts. \nMcGraw has
        helped out with charity events held by Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett
        Favre. The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation has featured McGraw (and at other
        times Faith Hill) performing concerts during dinners and auctions that benefit
        children with disabilities in Wisconsin and Mississippi. One instance is recorded
        on Favre''s official website. \nOn July 12, 2007, it was made public that
        McGraw and his wife Faith Hill, while in Grand Rapids, Michigan for a performance,
        donated $5000 to Kailey Kozminski, 3-year-old daughter of Officer Robert Kozminski,
        a Grand Rapids police officer who was killed on July 8, 2007 while responding
        to a domestic disturbance. \nIn June 2010, McGraw and his wife Faith Hill
        organized Nashville Rising, a benefit concert aimed to raise $2 million for
